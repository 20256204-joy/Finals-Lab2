                <p>The Baguio City Heritage Hill and Nature Park (formerly and still commonly known as the Diplomat Hotel) is an abandoned structure atop Dominican Hill, Baguio, Philippines. The local government initiated rehabilitation efforts, which was started in April 2022, through a 15 million Philippine pesos grant from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. The whole property on which it stands has been renamed as the Dominican Heritage Hill and Nature Park. A panoramic view of the city unfolds from its vantage point, the stone crucifix on the outdoor patio of the hotel's second floor.
