                <p>The Baguio Botanical Garden, formerly known as Imelda Park, is a botanical garden in Baguio, Philippines, located on Leonard Wood Road between Wright Park and Teacher's Camp. The garden, which was previously a zoo,was renamed to the Imelda Park by Ferdinand Marcos for his wife in 1970. The park closed for ten months in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, it underwent a renovation which made the park more aesthetic and added ramps.</p>
